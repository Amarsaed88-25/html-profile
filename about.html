<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>My name is Ammar Sayed
  Since my childhood, I was passionate about my love for the world of technology, so I was always learning and
  discovering, and I always dreamed of being a programmer, and this opportunity came and I actually joined college to
  study computer science, and I am the first person in my family to enter this field. </p>
<p> My love for the field also helped me discover that it not only benefits me in my professional life, but also in my
  practical life, and this is what made me work long hours without getting bored and create projects of my own away from
  academic assignments, and that it is a wonderful thing when your passion and work combine in one thing, so I try as
  much as possible. It is possible for me to learn more than I know, renew my mentality, and be open to what is new and
  coming </p>
